shpotify: A command-line interface to Spotify
=============================================

This is a simple Bash/Apple script to control Spotify from the command
line on a Mac. In order to use it:

1. Fetch a copy of this repository and make sure the `spotify` file in
   this folder is executable:

       chmod +x spotify

2. Copy the file to a convenient location in your `PATH`.

3. Run it by typing one of the following commands:

````
spotify play                    Resumes playback where Spotify last left off
spotify play [song name]        Searches for a song by name and plays it
spotify pause                   Pauses Spotify playback
spotify quit                    Stops playback and quits Spotify
spotify next                    Skips to the next track in the playlist
spotify prev                    Returns to the previous track in the playlist

spotify vol up                  Increase the volume by 10%
spotify vol down                Decrease the volume by 10%
spotify vol [value]             Set the volume to a value between 0 and 100

spotify status                  Shows the current play status including track details
spotify share                   Shows the current track URL and copies it to the clipboard for sharing

spotify toggle shuffle          Toggles shuffle playback mode
spotify toggle repeat           Toggles repeat playback mode

Need better interfaces:
Album and playlist playback etc.
spotify pos [value]             Needs better interface
